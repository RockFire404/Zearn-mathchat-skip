Real life human society is made up of different cultures, languages, and lifestyles. People can choose how they want to live and be themselves, but that can sometimes cause problems like conflict and unfairness. The society in "The Giver" is different because everything is controlled and everyone has specific roles to follow. This creates order, but it also means people don't have much freedom to be creative or grow as individuals. In "The Giver" society, people can't feel emotions or enjoy the same things as we do in real life, which makes it seem boring and not as exciting.
